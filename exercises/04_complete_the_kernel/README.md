# Complete the matrix multiply kernel

In this exercise, the indices `row_index` and `col_index` iterate through the arrays in row-major (down the first row, then down the second row, etc.) and column-major (down the first column, then down the second column, etc.) order, respectively.

Look at the matrix multiply kernel and decide which of these two indices should define the elements of arrays A and B.
